# Aymmetric cryptography
There are two sides in an encrypted communication: the sender, who encrypts the data, and the recipient, who decrypts it. As the name implies, asymmetric encryption is different on each side; the sender and the recipient use two different keys. Asymmetric encryption, also known as public key encryption, uses a public key-private key pairing: data encrypted with the private key can only be decrypted with the public key, and vice versa.

I create a multi module Maven project for show how to implement asymmetric cryptography by Java and spring boot.You need the following tools and technologies to develop the same.

    Spring-Boot 2.1.3.RELEASE
    Spring-aop 5.1.5.RELEASE
    Lombok 1.18.6
    JavaSE 1.8
    Maven 3.3.9
